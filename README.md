I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world at varying distances from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized a simple Python library and OpenWeatherMap API.

Based on the data we can see temperatures were higher in most cities in the Sothern Hemisphere compared to the North. While the North reached high temperatures like the South, we saw a brief incline in temperature, a peak, and then a significant decline into lower temperatures. A bit more dramatic than the Southern Hemisphere. The highest temperature is found at 0 latitude and as the latitude increases or decreases, the temperature drops.

More humidity is near the equator and in the northern hemisphere compared to the Southern hemisphere. Therefore, we see more cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere.

Overall, Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.
