# python-api-challenge
I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized simple Python library and OpenWeatherMap API.

Based on the data we can see temperatures were higher in most cities in the Sothern Hemisphere compared to the North. While the North reached high temperatures like the South, we saw an brief incline in temperature, a peak, and then a large decline into lower temperature. A bit more dramatic than the Southern hemisphere. The highest temperature is found at 0 latitude and as the latitude increases or decreases, temperature drops.

There is more humidity near the equator and in the northern hemisphere compared to the Southern hemisphere. Therefore, we see more cloudiness in the Northern hemisphere.

Overall, Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.
